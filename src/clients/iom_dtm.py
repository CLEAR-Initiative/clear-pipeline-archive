"""IOM DTM Services API v3 client.

Reference: https://dtmapi.iom.int/v3/ (OpenAPI spec in docs/IOM-DTMServiceAPI-V3.json).

We use the `/displacement/admin2` endpoint to fetch the latest displaced-
person counts per admin-2 district. Auth is an Azure APIM subscription
key sent via the `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key` header.

Response shape is not documented in the OpenAPI spec — only "200 Success".
From the public IOM DTM data we expect records like:

    {
      "operation": "...",
      "admin0Pcode": "SDN",
      "admin1Pcode": "SD01",
      "admin2Pcode": "SD0101",
      "admin2Name": "Jebel Aulia",
      "roundNumber": 7,
      "reportingDate": "2025-03-15",
      "numPresentIdpInd": 12345,   # primary: present IDPs (individuals)
      "numPresentIdpHH":  2500,    # households
      ...
    }

Real field names vary by operation and sometimes by round; we try a list
of common candidates and fall back gracefully when values are missing.

    DTM admin-level endpoints return one row per
    (destination_admin{N}, origin_admin1, displacementReason, assessmentType).
    To get the total IDP count at a destination, we have to sum across origins
    (and across reasons) for the same destination + round.

    `assessment_type_filter` accepts:
      - "BA"               — single type (legacy behaviour).
      - ["BA", "FM"]       — priority list. Aggregate the first type; for

    Each returned bucket records the `assessment_type` that produced it, so
    consumers can tell whether a number is from BA (current IDP stock) or FM
    (transit flow) — the two have different semantics.

    Steps (per type):
      1. Filter to matching `assessmentType` rows.
      2. Group by (admin{level}Pcode, roundNumber).
      3. Sum `numPresentIdpInd` across the group → population_displaced.
      4. Build a per-origin breakdown.
      5. Pick the latest round per pcode (tie-break by reportingDate).

    Returns `{admin_pcode: AggregatedDisplacement}`. Destinations with zero

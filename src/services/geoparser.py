"""Signal geoparser — extract event location from title + description.

The geoparser is **best-effort enrichment**, not a critical path. Every
failure mode returns None and the caller falls back to source-supplied
coordinates. Designed for ~100 signals/day with one outbound Nominatim
call per signal (or zero, if the cache is warm).

Pipeline:
  1. Extract candidate place names from title and (optionally) body
     using a small set of regex patterns. Title hits dominate body hits.
  2. Filter out organisation / generic stopwords ("Sudanese Armed Forces",
     "Reports", etc.) so we don't ship those to the geocoder.
  3. Classify each candidate as **landmark** (ends with a known suffix
     like "Airport", "Hospital") or **admin** (default).
  4. Detect disqualifying context — candidates immediately preceded by
     "transferred to", "fled toward", etc. get demoted.
  5. Rank: landmarks beat admin; title beats body; earlier beats later;
     disqualified candidates drop to the bottom.
  6. Send the single top candidate to Nominatim. Pick the best result
     (importance >= 0.3, within expected country codes).
  7. Return a structured `GeoparseResult`, or None if anything failed.

What this is NOT:
  - A general-purpose NER system. No spaCy, no transformers, no ML.
  - A noise-cleaning miracle. Garbage in, garbage out — but at least
    "garbage" returns None rather than misattributing a signal.
  - A precision-recovery engine. If both text and coords are at district
    granularity, no algorithm here makes that any finer.

# "Al-Obeid" (when the source headline-cased the article). The separator
# is "-" or whitespace ("al-Nahud", "Al Nahud" both match). Without this

# up capturing the post-prefix fragment alone ("Obeid", "Nahud") which
